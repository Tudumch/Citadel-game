# Citadel
Citadel - my pet-project for practice C++ and learn Unreal Engine. The game itself is an arcade third-person shooter similar to Unreal Tournament.
It has a lot of unfinished/testing features, so play at your own risk.

# Installation

If you want to compile the project from the source code - you need to install Unreal Engine 4.27.
